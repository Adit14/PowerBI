# PowerBI
I have created a dashboard using PowerBI based on a dataset commissioned by US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This dashboard shows the improved road safety over the time of 2007-2018 by state. The target NHTSA is 1.02 fatalities per 100,000,000 miles driven.

This dashboard has one KPI, one gauge, one filled map, a slicer to select state, 3 cards one shows the name of the state selected, second one shows number of fatalities and third one shows total miles driven.

There is a drill down analysis to three different pages, which shows bar graphs fatalities by Year and state, Miles (millions) by Year and State, Fatalities and Target 1.02 by Year and State.
